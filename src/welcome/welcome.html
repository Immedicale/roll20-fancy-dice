	<h1>Thank you for installing Fancy Dice for Roll20</h1>
	<p>To use the extension, join a Roll20 game and click on the extension's icon (the blue d20) in your browser. A pop-up will open, where you can change your settings and choose your dice.</p>
	<p>Every once in a while Roll20 updates their code, which can sometimes break the extension. If your 3D dice suddenly won't load, this is likely the cause. Please send me a message at tobloef@gmail.com or open an issue on <a href="https://github.com/tobloef/roll20-fancy-dice/issues/new">GitHub</a> if this happens and I will try to update the extension as soon as possible.</p>
	<p>If you want to get involved with adding new dice to the extension, please also feel free to get in touch, I would love to help you get started.</p>
	<p>I hope you enjoy the extension and have fun playing!</p>
